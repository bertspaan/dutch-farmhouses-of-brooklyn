- Site also includes a barn and yard thatâ€™s a remnant of the original 100-acre farm plot.
- Privately owned and occupied.
- Current owners are only the third family to own the house!
- Two Hessian mercenaries quartered at the house during the Revolutionary War (Captain Toepfer of the Ditfourth regiment and Lieut. M. Bach of the Hessen-Hanau Artillerie) scratched their names and units into windowpanes (the graffiti sections now removed and displayed inside).
- Around 1900, the originally south-facing house was jacked up and turned to the west to fit the new street grid, wiping out the original barns and slave quarters.
