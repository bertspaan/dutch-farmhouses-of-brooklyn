- Originally on a 30-acre farm plot located off of what was then called Ryder’s Lane (roughly where today’s East 29th Street is located), about 1.5 miles from Gravesend Village.  This lane was the access to many farmhouses in the extended Ryder family.
Moved in 1929 one block west and reoriented to the emerging street grid.
- Today, sandwiched between 20th-century semi-attached and row houses.
- Characteristic “Dutch curved eaves” on the roof (a style which some architectural historians say was actually brought to North America’s Dutch colonies by Fleming and Walloon refugees!)
- Privately owned and occupied.
